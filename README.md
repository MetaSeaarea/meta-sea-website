MetaSeaarea's main source of revenue will come from game protocols and NFT sales. The core of these numbers will be our player base, and a complete and mature game economic model will ensure the long-term stable operation of the game. Users participate in the construction and management of the game community, and also deeply participate in the development of the game. Unlike the other blockchain projects, the biggest holder of game tokens is not the in-house team, but every user and organization who contribute to and support MetaSeaarea.
